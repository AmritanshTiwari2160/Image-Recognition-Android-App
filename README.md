This project showcases an Android application developed using Kotlin, which leverages Firebase's Machine Learning Kit for on-device image labeling. The app allows users to capture images using the device's camera and then processes these images to recognize and label objects within them. This project demonstrates the integration of modern Android development practices with powerful machine learning capabilities.

**Features:**
1. Capture Images: Use your device's camera to capture images.
2. On-Device Image Labeling: Process captured images directly on the device to recognize and label objects.
3. Firebase ML Kit: Leverage Google's Firebase Machine Learning Kit for image recognition.
4. Real-Time Feedback: Get real-time labels and confidence scores for recognized objects.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface for capturing and viewing images.

**Built With:**
Kotlin: The programming language used.
Firebase ML Kit: For on-device image labeling.
Android Studio: The development environment used.
